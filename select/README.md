# Treats Server with Timeout: An Introduction to Goroutines and `select` in Go

Welcome to the Treats Server with Timeout project! This Go program provides a playful introduction to two important concepts in Go programming: goroutines and the `select` statement.

## Code Overview

This project simulates a treats server that serves treats to a your dog - `main`. However, to make it more exciting, we've added a timeout mechanism using goroutines and the `select` statement.

### `treatsServer` Function

The `treatsServer` function represents our treats provider. It runs as a goroutine, continuously serving treats to a channel named `bowl`. Each treat is served with a delightful delay of 5 seconds between servings.

### `main` Function

The `main` function is where the action begins. It initializes the `bowl` channel and starts the `treatsServer` goroutine to serve treats.

Next, it sets a timeout of 3 seconds using `time.After`. The program then waits for either a treat to be received from the `bowl` channel or for the timeout to occur using a `select` statement.

- If a treat is received within the timeout period, it joyfully prints a message indicating the received treat.
- If the timeout occurs before receiving a treat, it humorously suggests going for a walk instead of waiting too long for treats.

## Running the Program

To experience the joy of treats and timeouts firsthand, follow these simple steps:

1. Save the provided code into a file with a `.go` extension, such as `treats.go`.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the file.
3. Run the following command to execute the program:

```bash
go run treats.go
```

Sit back, relax, and enjoy the excitement as treats are served, and timeouts are handled with grace and humor.

Feel free to experiment with the code, tweak the timeouts, or add your own creative twists to the treats server. Happy coding and may your goroutines always run smoothly! üêæüç¨
